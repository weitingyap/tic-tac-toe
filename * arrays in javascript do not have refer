* arrays in javascript do not have reference equivalence; comparison operators do not compare values automatically (like in python); instead they compare references. I ran into difficulty checking for wins, but ultimately resolved this by using .some and .every methods to compare values.

edge cases 
- player tries to click on the same cell that isn't empty
- draw: clears the board


tickets 
- change players from array to object with keys 1 and 2
- change board to const
